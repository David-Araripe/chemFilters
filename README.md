# chemFilters

A collection of chemical filters, with some support for data visualization and analysis. At the moment, the supported filters are:

- RDKit filters based on RDKit implementation of [Pat Walter's version of the ChEMBL filters](https://github.com/PatWalters/rd_filters)*;
- Purchasability filters based on Andrew White's [molbloom](https://github.com/whitead/molbloom);
- Peptide filters based on Olivier BÃ©quignon's [PepSift](https://github.com/OlivierBeq/PepSift);
- Silly molecules filters based Olivier's fork of Pat Water's [silly walks](https://github.com/PatWalters/silly_walks);

*note: RDKit's implementation these chemical filters is only available from rdkit version 2023.03.1 onwards. Check here for the [release notes](https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/posts/2023-05-03-new-release-highlights.html).
